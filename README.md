1. Either clone this repo or download the zip and extract it anywhere you prefer.
2. In your omnibox (address bar), navigate to chrome://extensions
3. As shown above, check off **Developer mode** so that you can use local files for extensions.
4. Click **Load unpacked extension** and select the directory created when you either cloned the repo or extracted that zip file.

## Use
Assuming you have a spreadsheet where you're storing your housing postings...

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions in the browser. Under this extension, click on **Options** and reorder the attributes shown so that the order is the same as that of your spreadsheet's column's. *For instance, if your spreadsheet's first column is Title, set Title to 1.*
2. Navigate to a Craigslist or HotPads post for a specific apartment/house/etc.
3. Click on the extension's icon (to the right of the omnibox). An alert will pop up with the details of the post separated by tabs.
4. Copy the text content of the alert box.
5. Paste into a spreadsheet of your choosing. The tabs should put each piece of info into its own cell in its own column.
